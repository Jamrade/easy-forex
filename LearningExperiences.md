This is a place for me to document all of the challenges of the project

## Problem 1: Transfering states between pages

### Description of the Issue

Once the login is successful from the login page, a session token is provided. This session token is used for all account based queries and trades made. In an effort to not have to load the credentials document everytime a page is loaded or every 20 minutes (When the session token expires automatically) I wanted to store the session token in a binding to be shared across HTML pages.

My Initial thought process was to have files individual to the pages and then have a shared javascript file where, much like a class would, getter and setter methods for global bindings would be interfaced with between pages. This did not work however because everytime a new page loaded this "general" javascript interface it would reset the values of the bindings.

### Solution

Using cookies I was able to save both the session ID and the account ID to the client so they could be shared across pages.

## Problem 2: Session timeouts
